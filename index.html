<H2> If you are seeing this message congrats on being a step ahead of the competition. Welcome to my site
i'll be your host Lawrence. </H2>

    <P>Compared to most people I know, due to life's many mysteries, I have a pretty diverse job background. As for right now,
i'm currently a manager at Sunoco. Before I started working at Sunoco I was a certified welder for the past four year's.
After learning alot of the ins and outs of my field I decided that I wanted to take a different road in life and try to find a way
to give one of my other passions a chance to grow and a new way to challenge myself. It just so happened that I came across Per
Scholas' website at the right time in order to start my journey. If you're wondering what some of my other passions include, I love
sports like paintball and snowboarding, cars, computers, gaming, anime, flying and photography.</P>
